//
1. Check facts (contains facts target) if where is no target at facts => goto 2.
2. Find a rule with conclusion where conclusion is target (by name and count of variables)
3. Prove all predicates (subtargets) at rule.
4. If predicate (subtarget) in facts => proved subtarget => replace variables.
    4.1 If it has a variable => replace all occurencies of that variable with constant from db.
5. else If subtarget in rules conclusion:
    prove all predicates of that rule:
